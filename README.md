# web-scraping
Repository for my web scraping projects.
Have a look at the jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)

# duproprio
https://duproprio.com/

I scraped data from duproprio to get some information about houses for sale.
The result is then saved to a .csv file

# Pokemondb.net
https://pokemondb.net/

For this project I scraped all the data from more than 800 pages of pokemon.
The goal was to get the data for a future video game project. 
All the data is stored inside a pandas dataframe and exported to a .csv file.

I also made a GUI in python 3.6 and tkinter to view and sort some of the data.
